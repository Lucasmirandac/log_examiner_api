Explanation:
My idea in this code was to fetch csv data from the specified url and process this data into a map so the access to each user action would be more efficient.

I have used AI to convert the file into json so I thougth it would be better for manipulation, but that wasnt in the way I expect then I have used AI to fix it but with no sucess.

Last version of code is not compiling correctly.
